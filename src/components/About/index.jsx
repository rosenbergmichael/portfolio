    <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a hungry and motivated full stack web developer with a business background, who thrives in a collaborative environment 
        where I can utilize my strong communication and problem solving skills. My previous role in the Customer Experience 
        space formally introduced me to the companies and technologies responsible for creating better, more seamless 
        customer/user experiences, and this is what led me to pursue a career in software development. I'm seeking a new 
        challenge that will grant me the opportunity to improve our digital experiences firsthand. Passionate about new 
        adventures and a strong believer in never being too old to continue growing and learning new things.
      </p>

        Currently a Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React and Redux developer with a strong desire to add more programming 
        languages to my toolbelt. I am excited to bring my skill set to a team where together we can solve problems and 
        create amazing digital products and services!
      </p>

      <p>
        In my spare time, you can find me: rooting on my favorite sports teams (New York Giants, New York Mets, New Jersey Devils
        and Arsenal FC), enjoying new restaurants around NYC and exploring new countries around the world!
